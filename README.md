# About me! 

# You are my beloved partner . , 
â€” . greetings for the person who is reading this, i am Xingqiu. A part of the guhua clan and the second son of the feiyun commerce guild.

I apologize for my attitude if i may be rude and not polite to you or your friends. Sometimes I'm kind of mean with teases and jokes. Although, fret not, i can be polite as well. 

If you ask of my favorite? My favorite food can be any sea food, with a hint of spice can do too. My friend, chongyun, never liked the heat and sometimes i tease him with chili's on his plate! Don't tell him though, he might get mad and chase me around. 

I am a famous novelist from liyue, i like reading and listening to calm musics. 

My beloved friend, chongyun is one a kind. He is quite cold most of the times, but no one understands him more than i do. He might also know me more too. 

(i am just roleplaying! If you want to ask more questions about me, just find my github!) 

My least favorite food is... Carrots. It's something i dare not to explain of why i hate it. It's unnecessary... ðŸ“š

â€” My friend is like an open book to me, they always expect me to not know everytime. But their wrong. Huff, i wonder why they would expect me to just ignore such thing.

His faint blush is cute and the way his eyes are like crystals that keeps on shining forever even if theres no sunlight. His hair is like the midst of daylight, a beautiful cold sky, blue if not specific. Fading into a deep shade of blue before turning to its natural color.. He reminds me of ice.
